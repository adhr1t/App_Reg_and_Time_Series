## Problem 3
```{r}
new = c(16, 20, 24)
standard = c(28, 33, 35)
# full = c(16, 20, 24, 28, 33, 35)

onewayS = aov(new ~ standard)
onewayN = aov(standard ~ new)
summary(onewayS)
summary(onewayN)

```


## Problem 4
```{r}
Wetsuit <-c(1.57, 1.47, 1.42, 1.35, 1.22, 1.75, 1.64, 1.57, 1.56, 1.53, 1.49, 1.51)

NoWetsuit <-c(1.49, 1.37, 1.35, 1.27, 1.12, 1.64, 1.59, 1.52, 1.50, 1.45, 1.44, 1.41)

res <- t.test(Wetsuit, NoWetsuit, paired = TRUE)
res
```

Given that the p-value is so much lower than any alpha value we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in speed among those wearing a wetsuit and those not wearing a wetsuit.
